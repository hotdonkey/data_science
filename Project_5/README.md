### What case are we trying to solve?    
Modeling to evaluate approximate taxy's trip duration.

**Task conditions:**  
Dataset of taxy's trip

**Quality metrics**     
RMSE.

**What do we practice**     
Feature enginering, feature cleaning, feauture selection, modeling and hyper params optimisation.
