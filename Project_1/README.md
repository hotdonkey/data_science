### Project description    
Project of EDA practice with visualisation and data cleaning compounds on exampl of dataset from HH.ru

### What case are we trying to solve?    
Step-by-step data analisis with attempts to find some connections within the data and make some conclusions (in russian).

**Task conditions:**  
We have a raw data set from Head Hunter and cannot use nothing but buit-in Python tools and strict list of modules.

**Quality metrics**     
Mostly our metrics are questions on the SkillFactory online platform. Right answers are our signals on every 
step of data transformation that saying us we didn't ruined the whole data frame.

**What do we practice**     
Using basic moves in creating functions, working with pandas (mostly pandas) and visualing content via Seaborn, Matplotlib
and Pyplot.

### Short info about the data
Data set of aprox. 47k rows with duplicates, outliners and dummy-data and 14 features.

### Work stages 
Open data set.
Create data frame.
Do something with it (cleaning, creating new features, droping old features, etc.)
Visualise it.
Make some conclusions.
...
Profit.

### Result:  
Great success.

### Conclusion:  
As a first attempt in EDA we can say that this stage of Data Science work takes a lot of time and should be treated with
cautious and precision.
