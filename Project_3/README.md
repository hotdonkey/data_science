### What case are we trying to solve?    
Trying to clean and prepare the dataset to further modeling.

**Task conditions:**  
We have a dataset with hotels scoring which should be cleaned and prepared

**Quality metrics**     
MAE and MAPE metrics.

**What do we practice**     
Feature enginering, feature cleaning, feauture selection
