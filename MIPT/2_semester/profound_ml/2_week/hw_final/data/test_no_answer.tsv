meanwhile
,
though
windows
8
is
significantly
at
greater
risk
(
1
.
73
percent
)
compared
to
windows
8
.

,
according
to
redmond
'
s
report
,
it
'
s
still
significantly
safer
than
windows
7
,
windows
xp
,
or
windows
vista
.

windows
7
is
still
going
strong
even
though
the
day
was
about
windows
8
,
microsoft
announced
it
'
s
approaching
450
million
copies
of
windows
7
sold
thus
far
,
with
windows
7
consumer
usage
coming
in
greater
than
windows
xp
.

i
have
tried
windows
8
and
it
'
s
lighter
than
windows
xp
.

moreover
,
windows
8
is
even
lighter
on
your
resources
than
windows
7
(
but
heavier
than
windows
xp
,
of
course
).

that
means
that
for
most
consumers
,
choosing
a
windows
8
product
edition
is
simpler
than
it
'
s
been
since
october
2001
,
when
microsoft
released
windows
xp
in
two
flavors
,
windows
xp
home
edition
and
windows
xp
professional
edition
.

whatever
the
case
,
enterprises
in
general
will
find
that
upgrading
from
windows
7
to
windows
8
will
be
significantly
simpler
and
less
expensive
than
upgrading
from
windows
xp
to
windows
7
,
he
said
.

windows
8
is
21
times
and
6
times
safer
than
windows
xp
and
windows
7
respectively
.

as
per
microsoft
claims
,
windows
8
is
6
times
safer
than
windows
and
21
times
safer
than
windows
xp
from
a
virus
infection
perspective
.

the
most
secure
os
ever
made
:
according
to
microsoft
,
windows
8
is
21
times
safer
than
windows
xp
,
and
6
times
safer
than
windows
7
,
from
a
malware
infection
perspective
.

however
,
we
'
re
sure
at
least
on
one
point
now
that
the
new
windows
8
password
features
won
'
t
make
windows
8
password
safer
than
the
traditional
text
password
in
windows
xp
.

but
that
aside
,
windows
10
is
still
easier
to
navigate
than
mac
os
x
and
windows
8
,
has
better
access
to
files
than
in
android
,
and
is
faster
,
more
flexible
and
more
capable
than
windows
xp
and
the
home
and
enterprise
editions
of
windows
7
.

actually
,
from
things
i
'
ve
seen
,
windows
8
requires
less
of
the
hardware
than
windows
7
(
runs
faster
/
leaner
than
windows
7
on
the
same
hardware
)
and
windows
7
runs
as
good
as
(
or
better
than
)
windows
xp
.

firstly
,
windows
8
runs
faster
than
windows
xp
absolutely
.

windows
8
is
faster
than
windows
xp
or
windows
7
.

this
makes
windows
8
sales
34
%
better
than
windows
vista
,
and
about
15
%
higher
than
windows
xp
.

"
but
windows
xp
systems
had
an
infection
rate
that
was
six
times
higher
than
windows
8
."

the
malware
infection
rate
for
windows
xp
is
already
almost
six
times
higher
than
windows
8
systems
.

windows
8
devices
also
come
in
more
form
factors
,
so
you
could
find
that
a
windows
8
tablet
with
touch
is
far
easier
to
use
than
your
old
windows
xp
machine
.

the
touch
-
friendly
windows
8
software
is
much
better
at
juggling
work
and
play
than
windows
xp
tablet
pc
edition
.

i
'
d
suggest
windows
8
as
it
'
s
build
with
touch
in
mind
,
and
it
'
s
much
better
than
windows
7
and
windows
xp
when
using
a
touch
interface
.

actually
for
many
windows
xp
users
it
is
easier
to
migrate
to
linux
mint
than
to
windows
8
.

if
you
'
re
accustomed
to
the
windows
xp
layout
and
style
,
upgrading
to
windows
7
might
be
a
better
choice
than
windows
8
,
martini
said
.

perhaps
it
is
little
wonder
that
windows
xp
usage
continues
to
grow
faster
than
that
of
windows
8
.
x
.

it
is
also
similar
in
usability
to
windows
xp
,
ensuring
that
the
learning
curve
for
new
users
is
relatively
smoother
than
migrating
to
windows
8
.

in
my
opinion
,
transitioning
from
windows
xp
or
windows
7
to
linux
mint
or
ubuntu
will
be
much
easier
than
transitioning
to
windows
8
or
8
.

the

be
a

change
for
users
who

may
make

missouri

but
still
have
positive

for
example
,
colorado

missouri

show
obama

that
are
greater
than
his
lead
at
the
national

,
while
north
carolina
and
nevada
show
closer
races
-
gaps
of
about
four
percentage
points
.

the
addition
of
general
clark
into
the
presidential
campaign
could
shake
up
a
race
that
has
remained
fairly
static
for

,

,
former
senator
carol
moseley
braun

and
the
rev
.
al
sharpton
.

but
the
deciding
factor
could
be
snyder
'
s
commitment
to
his
players
and
to
the
fact
missouri
is
a
better
basketball
job

woods
always
got

--
to
beat
second
-
place
duke
by
21
strokes
at
the
university
of
georgia
golf
course
.

it
so
happens
that
georgia
has
higher
single
parenthood
levels
than
california
.

georgia
has
a
higher
percentage
of
blacks
(
30

in

,
there
was
no
difference
based
on
disability
status
,
but
overall
,
georgia
had
a
higher
proportion
of
disabled
enrollees
than
california
.

income
level
may
be
higher
in
southern
california
than
in
georgia
,
but
that
is
because
the
cost
of
living
is
higher
.

lopez
said
that
southern
states
such
as
georgia
and
north
carolina
have
seen
an
increase
in
undocumented
immigrants
because
their
economies
have
fared
better
than
california
since
the
1990s
.

i
'
m
sure
that
conservatives
will
argue
that
the
economies
in
indiana
,
missouri
,
oklahoma
and
georgia
will
be
ten
or
fifteen
times
better
than
those
of
new
york
,
california
or
illinois
-
and
republicans
will
ride
that
fact
to
victory
right
here
in
illinois
in
2014
!

a
100
%
privately
funded
project
in
say
georgia
would
have
a
much
easier
time
in
review
and
planning
and
cost
than
a
california
publicly
funded
one
.

it
is
much
easier
to
get
a
permit
in
georgia
,
but
you
have
even
fewer
freedoms
than
in
california
without
one
.

and
what
'
s
happening
is
the
growth
is
spilling
over
into
the
neighboring
states
,
so
that
places
like
nevada
and
places
in
georgia
are
growing
at
an
even
faster
rate
than
places
in
florida
and
california
.

also
of
note
,
obama
does
better
among
white
voters
in
arizona
,
new
jersey
and
california
than
he
does
in
georgia
and
missouri
.

administrative
data
from
california
suggest
a
slightly
higher
prevalence
in
black
than
in
white
children
(
40
),
but
a
previous
report
from
georgia
indicated
a
similar
prevalence
for
black
and
white
children
(
1
).

i
suspect
it
'
s
the
reason
why
southern
california
roads
are
so
much
better
than
michigan
'
s
.

if
roads
in
michigan
are
noticeably
worse
than
california
,
then
off
-
road
capable
suvs
must
be
mandatory
in
michigan
.

(
in
michigan
,
which
has
been
hit
even
harder
than
california
,
out

state
enrollment
in
the
university
of
michigan
system
is
closer
to
40
percent
.)

it
is
in
california
which
has
clearly
better
weather
than
michigan
.

(
news
flash
:
the
weather
in
michigan
in
february
is
very
different
than
the
weather
in
california
in
february
.)

she
enjoys
pointing
out
how
much
nicer
the
weather
is
in
california
compared
to
michigan
.

maybe
in
florida
or
california
that
is
normal
,
but
in
michigan
this
weather
is
far
from
normal
.

oregon

michigan

and
ohio
state
).

but
once
you
learn
a
few
tricks
and
live
here
in
southern
california
by
the
coast
,
the
chance
of
survival
is
better
than
say
michigan
.

frankie
ballard

for
his
summer

,
'

maybe
not
as
popular
as
california
or
florida
,
but
sure
as
hell
better
than
the
likes
of
michigan
,
those
inbred
southern
states
,
including
kentucky
and
those
prarie
states
.

florida
and
california

than
new

michigan
,
and
the
other
early
primary
states
,
especially
for
a
candidate
whose
greatest
strength
is
drawn
from
the
political
center
.

traditional
growth
states
such
as
florida
,
texas
,
california
,
arizona
and
nevada
will
continue
to
attract
new
residents
because
they
remain
better
places
to
live
than
idaho
,
nebraska
,
michigan
and
iowa
.

not
surprisingly
,
places
like
california
have
become
more
attractive
to
talented
workers
than
,
say
,
michigan
.

the
recognition
of
woman
'
s
rights
by
michigan
is
in
itself
the
greatest
single
victory
suffrage
has
won
,
on
account
not
only
of
the
population
of
that
state
,
which
is
somewhat
greater
than
that
of
california
,
but
chiefly
because
of
the
position
of
michigan
geographically
.

north
carolina
is
not
safer
than
california
.

or
maybe
the
criminals
in
the
southern
district
of
california
are
just
nicer
human
beings
,
and
are
therefore
25
times
likelier
to
have
mitigating
qualities
than
the
criminals
in
south
carolina
.

summer
temperatures
along
the
california

you
might

that

going

say
that

,
south

and

all
lost

higher

jobs
than
california
.

places
with
low
fuel
prices
like
venezuela
,
alabama
and
south
carolina
have
great
economies
because
there
is
so
much
more
disposable
income
to
spend
on
other
stuff
,
while
places
like
brazil
and
california
are
in
horrible
shape
because
they
have
high

i
knew

the

more

in
fact
,
my

short

considerably
greater
time
living
in
tennessee
and
north
carolina
.

it
therefore
stands
to
reason
that
a
template
for
north
carolina
might
be
a
bit
simpler
than
one
for
ohio
or
pennsylvania
,
albeit
not
exactly
the
same
,
as
some
sections
would
not
be
applicable
in
other
states
.

indiana
and
north
carolina
combined
have
more
delegates
than
pennsylvania
.

with
our
north
carolina
,
south
carolina
,
and
georgia
sale
,
we
'
ve
been
able
to
get
to
a
certain
sales
volume
much
faster
there
than
in
pennsylvania
,
new
jersey
,
connecticut
,
and
massachusetts
.

i
have
several
laptops
and
desktops
for
anything
other
than
making
calls
,
and
even
my
12
laptop
is
much
better
for
doing
anything
other
than
phone
calls
,
because
i
can
see
what
i
am
doing
better
.

my
laptop
is
easier
to
use
than
my
phone
.

i
would
argue
that
no
one
would
say
their
desktop
/
laptop
is
easier
to
use
than
their
phone
.

the
surface
is
more
portable
than
my
laptop
and
easier
to
use
for
those
productivity
issues
(
far
easier
to
type
on
a
10
.
6
screen
)
than
my
windows
phone
.

i
have
a
laptop
and
handheld
gaming
devices
for
everything
else
,
and
they
'
re
a
billion
times
easier
to
use
than
trying
to
do
anything
but
make
phone
calls
on
a
smartphone
is
.

4
.
they
are
bigger
,
making
them
easier
to
handle
in
the
same
way
that
its
easier
to
type
on
your
laptop
than
it
is
on
your
phone
.

.

fyi
-
i
like
my
ipad
but
usually
only
use
it
when
i
'
m
traveling
since
its
so
much
lighter
to
carry
around
than
a
laptop
and
way
easier
to
read
than
my
phone
.

plus
on
the
desktop
/
laptop
/
tablet
i
can
type
a
lot
faster
than
using
my
thumbs
on
my
phone
which
i
love
!

that
'
s
because
the
phone
has
a
worse
wifi
receiver
than
your
laptop
and
tablet
.

tablets
fill
the
more
portable
than
a
laptop
but
easier
to
see
than
a
phone
gap
.

a
tablet
or
small
laptop
-
much
nicer
than
a
phone
for
looking
at
google
maps
,
yelp
,
wikitravel
etc
.

secondly
,
laptop
cellular
modems
typically
deliver
faster
speeds
than
phones
,
so
my
results
don
'
t
necessarily
predict
phone
or
tablet
performance
.

the
reason
may
the
signal
receiver
of
my
phone
is
very
weak
compared
to
that
of
my
laptop
.

a
laptop
may
be
easier
to
see
for
the
reader
than
a
mobile
phone
.

the
other
point
about
this
is
that
it
'
s
so
much
easier
to
see
whether
there
'
s
wifi
available
with
a
phone
than
having
to
crack
the
laptop
open
.

gadget
tool
would
be
that
being
larger
than
a
phone
screen
,
it
is
easier
on
slightly
more
mature
eyes
and
it
is
a
helluva
lighter
to
haul
around
than
my
laptop
with
a
17
inch
screen
.

the
phone
feels
wonderful
in
my
hands
,
and
it
is
slightly
thinner
and
much
lighter
than
an
external
laptop
hard
disk
case
.

a
smart
phone
or
tablet
is
simply
easier
to
carry
around
than
a
laptop
.

the
larger
screen
makes
it
much
more
enjoyable
to
look
at
than
the
screen
of
a
smart
phone
,
and
it
'
s
smaller
and
easier
to
carry
around
than
a
laptop
.

the
fire
would
be
a
nice
compromise
(
more
comfortable
to
read
than
my
phone
,
easier
to
carry
around
than
my
laptop
),
but
i
'
ve
already
got
the
functionality
covered
by
other
gadgets
.

after
all
,
despite
the
small
screen
,
movies
really
do
look
great
on
the
cell
phone
,
and
it
'
s
a
lot
easier
to
carry
around
than
a
laptop
or
portable
dvd
player
.

the
tablet
is
easier
to
carry
around
than
a
laptop
and
larger
than
a
phone
so
it
is
in
my
"
goldilocks
zone
"
for
personal
devices
.

best
email
client
on
a
phone
,
have
my
work
and
non
work
emails
tiled
on
the
screen
,
helps
me
manage
my
email
alot
better
-
sometimes
it
'
s
just
quicker
to
read
email
on
my
phone
rather
than
checking
my
laptop
at
work
lol
.

i
was
wondering
if
anyone
uses
anything
on
an
ipad
or
phone
as
these
are
so
much
quicker
than
waiting
for
our
ancient
laptop
to
fire
up
!

data
should
be
data
,
no
matter
how
you
use
it
...
i
guess
the
idea
is
,
on
the
phone
you
wil
get
bored
a
lot
quicker
surfing
than
you
would
on
a
real
pc
/
laptop
,
so
to
discourage
that
use
...
.

even
when
my
laptop
is
easily
within
reach
,
i
can
check
my
personal
email
far
quicker
on
my
phone
.

well
,
if
you
leave
your
cellphone
sitting
around
,
it
'
s
a
lot
easier
to
steal
than
a
desktop
,
and
somewhat
easier
than
a
laptop
or
tablet
.

i
do
bring
my
purse
into
the
restroom
,
of
course
,
since
a
wallet
/
phone
is
much
smaller
and
easier
to
steal
than
a
laptop
.

it
is
easier
to
steal
laptops
,
i
guess
,
than
phones
because
at
one
point
one
has
to
put
the
laptop
down
whereas
phones
can
be
securely
placed
in
the
pockets
.

even
though
the
wifi
specs
on
the
phone
are
better
than
my
laptop
,
i
am
fine
with
it
being
only
as
fast
as
the
laptop
,
or
even
a
little
slower
.

wifi
on
this
phone
is
faster
than
my
laptop
and
thats
with
standard
sights
,
not
mobile
.

get
a
phone
with
wifi
for
the
web
and
an
akai
mpc
that
ll
do
much
better
work
than
shitty
laptop
setups
.

when
you
can
use
your
mobile
phone
or
3g
ipad
on
the
go
it
is
an
easier
option
than
finding
yourself
a
wifi
hotspot
and
getting
your
laptop
out
.

i
use
my
gmail
frequently
on
my
smart
phone
because
it
is
faster
to
check
my
email
from
here
rather
than
logging
on
to
my
laptop
and
waiting
for
the
slow
carroll
wifi
to
start
up
.

this
phone
is
blazing
fast
,
it
'
s
as
fast
as
a
laptop
!!
it
can
blaze
through
web
pages
at
lighting
fast
speeds
and
operates
them
smoother
than
any
other
phone
,
even
the
3gs
.
it
also
is
compatible
with
tons
of
apps
from
google
.
and
i
love
that
it
comes
unlocked
,
that
is
one
of
favorite
things
about
it
.

the
screen
is
bigger
than
a
phone
,
and
the
device
is
easier
to
hold
than
a
laptop
,
and
the
multi
-
touch
interface
does
make
it
easier
to
navigate
around
a
page
,
zoom
into
text
,
etc
.
.

the
unnamed
device
will
sell
for
less
than
$
1
,
000
,
have
a
modem
jack
that
connects
to
a
phone
line
,
and
is
supposed
to
be
easier
and
cheaper
than
a
bulky
laptop
.

thus
,
the
cordless
phone
100
(
and
,
to
a
lesser
degree
,
the
organizer
200
)
is
much
simpler
than
a
full
blown
dmt
/
ofdm
unit
as
represented
by
the
laptop
300
.

sounds
like
another
approach
to
try
to
reach
that
valhalla
of
the
blending
of
one
'
s
computer
and
one
'
s
tv
,
along
with
one
'
s
phone
,
using
an
os
that
'
s
simpler
than
one
'
s
full
-
fledged
desktop
or
laptop
computer
.

in
short
its
often
simpler
to
use
a
mobile
phone
than
it
is
a
pc
or
laptop
'.

i
did
hook
my
phone
up
via
mhl
,
and
it
worked
,
but
it
was
simpler
to
grab
the
laptop
and
go
that
way
.

but
from
what
i
'
ve
heard
,
mobile
broadband
in
its
current
state
is
not
going
to
be
any
faster
or
more
reliable
than
my
iphone
,
which
is
much
lighter
and
easier
to
carry
on
trips
than
a
laptop
.

the
iphone
was
lighter
than
carrying
recording
equipment
and
a
laptop
.

i
'
m
just
saying
that
there
is
an
addressable
market
for
devices
larger
than
iphone
that
can
better
handle
functions
that
otherwise
could
only
be
done
with
a
laptop
.

we
find
the
iphone
to
be
much
easier
to
use
than
android
based
smartphones
and
we
are
considering
replacing
our
pc
and
laptop
with
a
mac
desktop
,
a
macbook
air
and
or
an
ipad
tablet
.

users
who
use
the
iphone
as
a
personal
hotspot
on
ios
7
can
now
see
how
much
data
they
have
used
on
the
iphone
as
a
personal
hotspot
,
which
is
important
because
it
is
easier
to
use
data
faster
while
connecting
a
laptop
to
the
iphone
5s
or
ipad
.

in
2010
,
he
launched
the
ipad
,
that
magical
tablet
touchscreen
computer
-
bigger
than
an
iphone
,
smaller
and
friendlier
than
a
laptop
-
that
quickly
became
the
it
gadget
of
the
year
,
selling
a
million
units
in
a
month
.

apple
isn
'
t
saying
much
about
the
possibility
of
a
tablet
computer
,
but
industry
watchers
predict
it
will
be
a
thin
,
handheld
device
with
a
10
.
1
-
inch
touch
screen
,
making
it
bigger
than
the
iphone
yet
smaller
and
lighter
than
the
typical
laptop
.

i
must
admit
i
'
d
be
lost
without
my
iphone
-
and
ipad
,
which
is
much
easier
to
carry
around
than
a
laptop
!

since
the
new
iphone
5
supports
videos
up
to
1080p
,
movies
will
do
look
great
on
the
new
device
,
and
it
'
s
a
lot
easier
to
carry
around
than
a
laptop
or
portable
dvd
player
.

imagine
handing
your
iphone
over
to
a
friend
to
show
them
a
gorgeous
new
bracelet
:
that
'
s
far
friendlier
-
and
likelier
to
lead
to
a
sale
-
than
awkwardly
turning
a
laptop
around
.

but
,
everyone
we
'
ve
talked
with
who
uses
their
iphone
/
ipod
for
reading
says
it
'
s
much
easier
on
the
eyes
than
a
laptop
screen
.

ipad
:
because
the
portability
of
the
iphone
married
with
the
functionality
of
a
large
screen
can
do
some
things
better
than
a
pocket
-
sized
device
can
,
and
some
things
better
than
a
laptop
can
.

apple
iphone
5
white
includes
a
4
-
inch
display
,
the
sgs3
comes
in
at
4
.
8
-
inches
,
that
'
s
still
greater
than
the
modern
iphone
,
the
4s
is
simply
3
.
5
-
inches
so
a
4
-
inch
iphone
5
will
only
be
fractionally
...
keyword
:
laptop
.

but
the
pixel
density
on
my
iphone
5
is
a
lot
greater
than
that
of
my
computer
,
so
watching
anime
on
my
phone
looks
great
in
comparadon
to
my
laptop
and
my
ps3
can
stream
on
720
which
is
the
mac
output
of
my
tv
anyways
.

i
have
a
laptop
and
a
standard
mobile
phone
that
have
far
greater
combined
capacity
than
an
iphone
.

it
'
s
possible
to
do
this
from
a
laptop
as
well
,
of
course
,
but
it
'
s
a
lot
easier
to
get
to
your
iphone
than
to
open
up
your
laptop
.

the
2520
uses
a
laptop
-
like
circular
plug
that
is
actually
easier
to
attach
than
most
,
but
both
the
surface
and
new
ipad
plug
are
far
easier
in
the
dark
than
the
damn
micro
-
usb
plug
that
all
but
the
iphone
use
to
charge
(
including
most
small
tablets
).

for
this
i
would
rather
use
pd
directly
from
the
rjdj
composerpack
or
through
the
rjc1000
on
a
laptop
,
because
i
can
run
it
at
a
decent
higher
samplerate
and
i
can
use
better
microphones
than
on
the
iphone
.

note
:
many
mobile
devices
,
notably
the
iphone
4
and
ipad
2
,
have
high
resolution
displays
with
a
much
higher
pixel
density
than
desktop
and
laptop
monitors
.

some
studies
have
even
confirmed
that
the
iphone
5
has
a
higher
level
of
quality
and
performance
than
the
majority
of
tablets
and
low
-
end
laptop
computers
and
netbooks
as
well
.

plywood
is
easier
to
rework
than
steel
.

i
'
d
have
to
agree
...
aluminum
or
marine
plywood
heavily
epoxy
coated
are
better
than
stainless
steel
in
most
cases
...
and
far
easier
to
work
.

plywood
has
greater
tensile
strength
than
steel
per
weight
.

the
patented
,
extremely
durable
ssl
lining
is
four
times
more
corrosion
resistant
than
galvanized
steel
the
puncture
strength
is
nearly
six
times
greater
than
0
.
25
"
plywood
and
over
,
four
times
greater
than
mdpe
plastic
the
rigid
core
is
bonded
to
steel
ply
to
prevent
damage
from
repeated
forklift
impact

plywood
is
also
,
pound
for
pound
,
stronger
than
steel
.

pound
for
pound
,
plywood
is
stronger
than
steel
in
static
bending
strength
.

hardwood
plywood
is
,
pound
for
pound
,
stronger
than
steel
in
static
bending
strength
.

pound
for
pound
veneer
core
plywood
is
stronger
than
steel
in
static
bending
strength
due
to
cross
-
layered
structure
.

expanded
metal
therefore
needs
more
support
structure
below
,
so
ultimately
,
timber
or
structural
plywood
ramps
end
up
being
lighter
and
cheaper
than
steel
.

maybe
cut
some
plywood
gussets
to
attach
post
and
beam
,
one
on
each
side
,
this
is
cheaper
than
steel
brackets
.

and
because
they
'
re
made
of
steel
and
include
high
-
tech
insulation
,
they
'
re
supposed
to
be
more
efficient
-
and
therefore
cheaper
to
run
-
than
the
older
plywood
and
sheet
-
metal
barns
still
used
on
many
tobacco
farms
.

i
will
use
plywood
,
that
sounds
like
a
better
idea
than
1x
lumber
,
and
probably
cheaper
too
.

open
frame
using
2x4
stud
lumber
was
much
cheaper
than
double
plywood
.

today
i
priced
some
1
"
roughcut
lumber
for
building
more
nucs
and
it
was
actually
cheaper
than
using
1
/
2
"
plywood
.

the
home
depot
red
oak
plywood
is
5
-
10
%
cheaper
than
from
a
"
real
"
lumber
yard
,
but
not
half
the
quality
.

i
think
3
/
4
plywood
is
much
better
to
use
because
it
is
so
much
stronger
per
pound
than
straight
lumber
.

"
plywood
is
more
flexible
,
and
generally
stronger
,
than
lumber
of
the
same
species
and
dimensions
."

i
also
thought
that
plywood
is
stronger
and
more
rigid
than
1
solid
piece
of
lumber
.

plywood
is
cheaper
and
often
stronger
than
solid
wood
,
easy
to
find
at
home
-
improvement
or
lumber
stores
,
and
it
looks
good
.

you
can
dislike
plywood
as
much
as
you
like
but
it
'
s
engineering
characteristics
say
you
can
build
far
lighter
with
ply
than
you
ever
could
with
lumber
.

he
also
said
it
would
be
lighter
to
make
this
load
bearing
plywood
deck
than
a
deck
from
heavy
composite
lumber
that
i
was
thinking
about
.

initially
,
the
technique
was
called
balloon
framing
because
the
2
x
4
and
2
x
6
framing
members
(
dimensional
lumber
)
were
so
much
lighter
than
in
heavy
timber
.

"
in
some
situations
,
rather
than
transport
green
lumber
that
is
water
-
heavy
to
a
larger
kiln
,
you
could
plug
-
in
the
solar
hybrid
kiln
and
dry
timber
on
site
,
and
then
transport
much
lighter
dried
wood
for
further
processing
."

glued
laminated
timber
(
glulam
)
has
greater
strength
and
stiffness
than
comparable
dimensional
lumber
and
,
pound
for
pound
,
is
stronger
than

founder
says
that
timber
components
are
far
stronger
than
those
made
from
milled
lumber
and
can
compete
with
concrete
and
steel
.

unlike
the
light
-
frame
or
stud
construction
used
to
build
houses
and
low
-
rises
,
mass
timber
is
made
by
bonding
together
thin
layers
of
wood
to
create
a
material
that
is
much
stronger
and
more
fire
-
resistant
than
lumber
.

glulam
,
an
engineered
timber
product
,
provides
greater
strength
than
sawn
lumber
for
longer
span
applications
.

forested
areas
have
been
expanding
every
year
,
with
the
increase
in
standing
timber
greater
than
that
of
felled
lumber
.

engineered
lumber
may
be
available
in
longer
lengths
and
is
more
uniform
than
solid
timber
;
it
doesn
'
t
have
knots
,
warping
or
cupping
.

the
form
is
created
using
laminated
veneer
lumber
-
not
great
for
the
planet
,
as
it
consists
of
layers
of
wood
held
together
with
adhesives
-
but
it
does
stay
beautiful
longer
than
conventional
timber
.

a
twelve
-
story
building
in
portland
is
being
constructed
with
the
product
,
cross
-
laminated
timber
,
or
clt
,
which
is
lighter
,
so
it
goes
up
easier
and
faster
than
concrete
does
...
it
'
s
also
quieter
in
construction
,
sheine
told
the
guardian
.

although
timber
sleepers
have
good
elasticity
and
are
lighter
and
easier
to
handle
than
concrete
sleepers
,
their
main
drawback
is
short
service
life
due
to
deterioration
.

the
advantages
this
offers
are
quite
exciting
-
timber
panels
are
much
lighter
than
concrete
,
more
easily
worked
and
easier
and
safer
to
erect
[

].

the
massive
timber
is
lighter
than
concrete
,
but
manage
wider
spans
than
light
timber
floors
in
general
,
which
means
easier
adaptation
to
existing
support
spacing
.

timber
is
a
lighter
and
more
environmentally
-
friendly
building
material
that
can
be
stronger
and
safer
in
earthquakes
than
traditional
concrete
and
steel
structures
that
currently
dominate
the
building
landscape
.

winistorfer
said
timber
bridges
are
less
expensive
,
can
be
built
faster
than
concrete
or
steel
,
and
require
less
specialized
labor
to
build
.

new
structural
systems
like
cross
-
laminated
timber
panels
can
score
multiple
leed
points
,
cost
less
,
and
are
faster
to
build
with
than
steel
or
concrete
.

once
your
concrete
foundation
is
down
you
will
find
that
the
erection
of
a
timber
garage
is
much
faster
than
any
concrete
or
brick
built
garage
.
less
waste
and
less
mess
during
constuction
is
also
a
major
factor
to
consider
.

timber
is
strong
,
light
and
reliable
making
timber
construction
simpler
and
safer
than
steel
or
concrete
construction
.

well
-
designed
,
properly
constructed
timber
buildings
can
be
even
safer
in
earthquakes
than
ferro
-
concrete
ones
.

the
replacement
of
timber
track
components
is
responsible
for
producing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
six
times
greater
than
equivalent
reinforced

reinforced
concrete

can
span
greater
distances

with
respect
to
the
absolute
value
of

ee
,
the
amount
associated
with
the

was
greater
than
the
timber
case
by
almost
7
terajoules

'

houses
with
suspended
timber
floors
are
a
good
example
of
where
this
works
-
they
can
be
ripped
out
,
dropped
by
as
much
as
a
foot
and
replaced
with
a
concrete
floor
to
make
the
whole
space
feel
bigger
.

massive
timber
is
heavier
than
light
timber
systems
,
which
makes
it
difficult
to
compete
with
such
,
concerning
handling
of
volume
elements
,
whereas
it
is
far
lighter
than
concrete
elements
systems
,
which
are
mainly
transported
to
the
site
as

elements
.

their
light
weight
also
gives
savings
to
the
timber
supporting
trusses
which
will
be
less
than
when
supporting
heavier
concrete
tiles
.

although
a
hollow
-
core
slab
weighs
far
less
than
a
solid
concrete
slab
,
it
is
still
a
considerably
heavier
arrangement
than
the
typical
timber
and
plasterboard
installation
.

concrete
columns
are
stronger
than
timber
post
and
steel
is
superior
to

the
timber

to
be
stronger

amazingly
,
the
bus
travelled
faster
and
was
far
smoother
than
the
overland
truck
.

off
-
peak
depends
more
on
frequency
,
but
even
if
the
bus
only
goes
every
half
hour
,
it
would
still
be
slightly
faster
than
the
train
,
unless
some
asphalt
truck
spills
its
contents
across
all
lanes
of
traffic
.

using
the
truck
or
van
would
be
alot
faster
vs
the
long

ride
.

maybe
the
fastest
out
food
truck
i
'
ve
ever
been
to
,
so
much
faster
than
burger
bus
.

in
my
youth
,
i
'
ve
always
preferred
hitching
a
ride
with
a
truck
driver
than
ride
the
bus
,
as
i
would
invariably
get
there
faster
,
and
i
never
really
felt
unsafe
.

bus
is
20
times
easier
to
drive
than
towing
our
trailer
behind
our
f450
truck
which
is
unexpected
.

a
school
bus
might
be
even
easier
to
move
than
a
truck
due
to
its
overall
density
,
but
it
would
also
be
heavier
.

i
would
think
a
school
bus
based
platform
would
be
easier
to
drive
than
a
semi
-
trailer
combination
,
and
that
repairs
would
be
cheaper
since
the
engine
in
school
buses
seem
to
be
smaller
than
found
in
a
full
fledged
semi
truck
.

it
'
s
a
heck
of
a
lot
easier
to
do
on
a
truck
than
a
bus
.

i
can
tell
you
that
converting
a
truck
is
a
whole
bunch
easier
then
converting
a
bus
.

a
car
or
truck
is
a
whole
lot
easier
to
drive
than
a
55
-
passenger
school
bus
on
an
icy
road
.

i
used
to
say
that
the
average
italian
bus
driver
eats
better
on
a
day
-
to
-
day
basis
than
the
average
american
ceo
,
because
of
the
easy
access
to
quality
,
fresh
,
well
-
prepared
food
at
the
local
market
,
the
local
restaurant
,
the

.

in
fact
,
the
nhtsa
says
that
traveling
by
school
bus
is
seven
times
safer
than
traveling
by
car
or
truck
.

the
shuttle
is
a
decent
space
truck
,
but
we
need
a
cheaper
(
and
safer

space

."

the
truck
/
axle
(
passive
unpowered
unit
)
is
probably
havier
heavier
than
for
a
1
-
ton
but
then
again
the
whole
bus
is
heavier
.

the
humpback
whale
is
"
longer
than

heavier
than

for
instance

would
love
that
bus
,
that
was
a
nice
story
the
bus
ride
had
to
be
better
than
him
stealing
a
delivery
truck
.

you
wake
up
on
the
bus
--
and
it
even
happens
now
,
where
traveling
is
a
lot
nicer
than
it
was
before
--
and
we
'
ve
pulled
into
some
truck
stop
in

according
to
a
1988
study
by
dr
.
liu
'
s
colleague
at
the
university
of
missouri
,
j
.
p
.
wu
,
transporting
grain
by
pipeline
is
cheaper
than
by
truck
or
train
as
long
as
the
throughput
is
greater
than
approximately
1
million
tons
(
32
million
bus
).

the
truck
driver
is
definitely
more
at
fault
than
the
bus
driver
but
i
think
bus
drivers
should
be
held
a
greater
standard
of
safety
/
caution
.

using
this
same
logic
,
we
could
assume
that
a
monster
truck
is
faster
than
a
porsche
,
or
a
school
bus
is
capable
of
higher
speed
than
a
jaguar

type
.

with
a
more
relaxing
and
versatile
interior
than
the
large
truck

based
suvs
,
the
acadia
also
delivers
higher
fuel
economy
and
better
handling
-
in
this
case
,
maneuverability
more
like
a
large
car
than
a
bus
.

the
lateral
displacement
criteria
is
less
for
a
bus
because
a
large
bus
has
a
longer
wheelbase
than
a
truck
tractor
and
higher
steering
ratio
,
which
makes
it
less
responsive
than
a
truck
tractor
.

developed

the

that
'
s
as
long

wide
as
a

and
a
good

taller
--
can
be
problematical
,
since
u
-
turns
and
even
right
and
left
turns
on
narrow
suburban
streets
are
virtually
out
of
the
question
.

fact
is
,
adidas
provided
a
better
package
and
got
the
deal
by
agreeing
to
outfit
all
ku
sports
teams
,
unlike
nike
.

adidas
is
growing
faster
than
nike
in
other
asian
markets
,
too
,
notably
in
china
.

adidas
reported
a
15
per
cent
sales
increase
in
china
last
year
,
growing
faster
than
its
rivals
including
nike
of
the
united
states
and
home
-
grown
brand
li
ning
amid
intense
competition
.

i
also
tried
using
a
cheaper
adidas
trail
shoe
and
,
although
better
than
the
nike
,
was
pretty
bad
.

adidas
apparel
also
goes
on
sale
sooner
and
is
cheaper
than
nike
sale
apparel
.

i
like
adidas
,
personally
-
mostly
because
i
can
get
it
a
bit
cheaper
online
than
nike
.

while
adidas
products
are
generally
cheaper
than
nike
products
,
much
of
the
pricing
can
be
directly
proportional
to
the
type
of
technology
incorporated
into
the
shoe
.

i
don
'
t
have
anything
against
adidas
,
but
i
do
think
that
our
uni
'
s
materials
look
cheaper
than
the
nike
ones
(
example
:
the
up
-
and
-
down
curves
running
across
the
numbers
for
the
first
2
years
with
adidas
).

while
the
video
cuts
off
before
a
full
explanation
,
it
appears
kanye
intends
for
his
adidas
collaborations
to
be
produced
in
greater
quantities
than
his
nike
venture
,
hopefully
making
it
easier
for
all
his
fans
to
access
a
pair
.

adidas
fan
apparel
is
nothing
compared
to
what
nike
has
to
offer
.

7
reasons
adidas
is
a
better
fit
for
kanye
than
nike
.

and
to
prove
it
,
we
came
up
with
a
list
of
the
7
reasons
why
adidas
is
going
to
be
a
better
fit
for
kanye
west
than
nike
.

after
hearing
kanye
speak
at
the
conference
,
we
can
'
t
help
but
think
that
the
situation
he
has
going
with
adidas
right
now
will
ultimately
be
better
for
him
in
the
long
run
than
the
relationship
he
had
with
nike
.

plus
,
adidas
is
better
for
people
w
/
wide
feet
than
nike
,
and
they
'
re
more
flexible
than
some
.

the
nike
shoes
are
currently
tied
with
or
slightly
lighter
than
the
most
recent
adidas
shoe
,
the
d

if
the

than
adidas

football
cleat
,
and
the
macbook

is

5
pounds
lighter
than
the
macbook

,
the
race
to
the
lightest
is
clearly
underway
.

,
adidas

and
nike

more
than
three
times
as
much
on

,
at

well
apparently
from
media
reports
its
something
to
do
with
adidas
being
more
willing
at
the
moment
to
pledge
higher
amounts
of
money
into
their
teams
than
nike
are
,
so
maybe
it
could
see
a
few
teams
switch
from
nike
to
adidas
.

if
adidas
is
so
much
worse
than
nike
than
somebody
better
tell
the
nfl
.

a
big
reason
why
nike
got
the
nfl
contract
is
they
are
much
better
at
marketing
sports
gear
than
reebok
/
adidas
.

notre
dame
has
contracts
with
adidas
and
champion
,
which
are
no
better
than
nike
,
he
said
.

the
two
designs
nike
has
come
up
with
for
the
team
so
far
have
both
been
winners
-
much
better
than
the
atrocities
adidas
forked
out
by
the
end
of
their
contract
.

signed
new
contract
with
adidas
...
making
$
3
.
5
million
more
annually
than
nike
contract
.

nike
now
spends
more
on
non
-
traditional
brand
marketing
than
any
of
the
other
top
100
us
advertisers
,
while
its
revenues
and
income
continue
to
grow
at
a
faster
pace
than
those
of
its
closest
rivals
,
such
as
adidas
.

adidas
can
do
it
in
the
design
,
but
nike
has
significantly
better
marketing
.

i
have
ocd
about
matching
stuff
when
i
'
m
playing
sports
,
so
i
wear
all
nike
stuff
because
nike
shoes
fit
my
feet
better
than
adidas
/
puma
/
etc
(
and
i
'
ve
worn
nike
since
long
before
i
even
played
tennis
).

the
nike
deal
would
be
worth
less
but
they
would
probably
make
more
because
lots
more
people
would
buy
it
and
the
fit
and
quality
are
far
superior
to
both
adidas
and
ua
.

i
'
ve
always
personally
liked
nike
much
better
than
adidas
--
better
quality
,
better
design
...
practically
all
of
my
sporting
outfits
are
from
nike
,
and
i
rarely
gave
adidas
a
thought
.

but
i
never
had
a
single
complaint
about
the
nike
product
...
i
also
find
that
the
quality
of
nike
'
s
compression
gear
is
far
superior
to
under
armour
or
adidas
.

nike
might
have
a
better
look
to
their
shoes
,
i
'
ll
give
them
that
,
but
adidas
is
superior
in
comfort
and
especially
in
quality
of
shoe
.

that
'
s
likely
already
in
your
hand
-
your
smartphone
-
rather
than
digging
around
for
the
wallet
that
holds
that
credit
card
.

except
for
the
novelty
factor
,
mobile
payments
aren
'
t
much
easier
than
fetching
a
card
out
of
a
wallet
or
cash
out
of
a
pocket
.

in
theory
,
mobile
payments
should
be
faster
than
rooting
through
your
wallet
or
purse
for
spare
change
.

and
because
mobile
phones
are
widely
and
often
used
,
customers
usually
notice
when
they
'
re
missing
their
phone
faster
than
they
would
a
wallet
or
check
book
.

consumers
may
be
concerned
about
having
their
cards
in
their
mobile
phone
,
but
actually
the
mobile
phone
is
going
to
be
a
safer
place
to
have
your
cards
than
your
existing
physical
wallet
,
he
added
.

because
information
is
highly
encrypted
,
mobile
commerce
may
be
safer
than
credit
cards
stored
in
your
wallet
.

and
for
consumers
worried
about
mobile
payment
security
,
isis
touts
their
system
as
safer
than
your
existing
wallet
.

donahoe
'
s
argument
was
that
there
isn
'
t
a
shred
of
financial
information
stored
on
the
mobile
phone
,
which
makes
it
a
much
safer
entity
to
lose
than
the
wallet
by
comparison
.

,
but
people
will
typically
realize
that
they
are
without
their
mobile
phone
quicker
than
noticing
the
loss
of
a
card
or
their
physical
wallet
which
is
an
additional
security
measure
in
itself
.

google
inc
.
is
betting
its
latest
mobile
payments
incarnation
-
android
pay
-
will
work
better
than
google
wallet
did
.

we
'
re
waiting
to
see
if
apple
can
pull
off
mobile
payments
,
and
if
it
can
create
a
better
system
than
google
wallet
.

the
demographics
of
mobile
device
users
who
prefer
qr
codes
also
show
the
acceptance
of
qr
codes
as
the
go
-
to
mobile
payment
system
,
even
greater
than
nfc
,
as
with
google
wallet
or
isis
.

it
turns
out
that
searching
through
the
digital
contents
of
a
person
'
s
mobile
phone
is
more
intrusive
than
rifling
through
an
address
book
,
wallet
,
or
purse
.
